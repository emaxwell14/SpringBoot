----------------

If you are using Gradle, you can run the application using ./gradlew bootRun. Or you can build the JAR file using
./gradlew build (OR java -jar)

Then you can run the JAR file:
java -jar build/libs/gs-accessing-data-jpa-0.1.0.jar

It is also possible to run a packaged application with remote debugging support enabled. This allows you to attach a
debugger to your packaged application:

$ java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=8000,suspend=n \
-jar target/myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

TEST:
java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=8000,suspend=n -jar build/libs/SpringBoot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
