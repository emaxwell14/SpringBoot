Notes entity is not mapped. Because its hibernate??
Replace query with getAll in DAO
update save note method

Added custom build steps. Working with debugger
Can I remove build step as ont need jar. Running in ide so can i just use bootrun

Added schema-h2.sql. Could also try import.sql for all databases and eg. data-h2 for adding default data.
Depends on spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto being set to one of the auto update settings

If you are using Gradle, you can run the application using ./gradlew bootRun. Or you can build the JAR file using
./gradlew build (OR java -jar)

Then you can run the JAR file:
java -jar build/libs/gs-accessing-data-jpa-0.1.0.jar

It is also possible to run a packaged application with remote debugging support enabled. This allows you to attach a
debugger to your packaged application:

$ java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=5005,suspend=n \
-jar target/myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

TEST:
java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=5005,suspend=n -jar build/libs/SpringBoot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
